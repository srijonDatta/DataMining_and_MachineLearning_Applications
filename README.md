# DataMining_and_MachineLearning_Applications
Applying five different Machine Learning Classification Techniques in three different datasets and reporting the comparative study between the models' predictions and accuracy. All the codes are written in R programming language. 

## PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS IN DETAIL :

FraudulentTransactionsIdentification:
Analysing 10,48,575 credit card transactions history to identify fraudulent and non‐fraudulent transactions by training two machine learning models: Decision Tree and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Finally, compare the models’ performances on the test data using ROC Curve, AUC, Confusion Matrix etc.

Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction: 
Analysing 1,03,904 passenger survey data of a USA airline to predict the overall passengers’ satisfaction level based on the different survey scores on the various services offered using two machine learning techniques, Random Forest and Naive Bayes Classifier. Finally, compare the models’ performances on the test data using ROC Curve, AUC, Confusion Matrix etc. and opt for the best-performed model on the test data with logical argument.

Diamond Price Prediction: 
Analysing 53,940 different diamond prices based on 11 different physical properties and developing a Multiple Linear Regression Model to predict the diamond prices. All the necessary assumptions have been verified before modelling and the model performance has been estimated using MSE and RMSE.
